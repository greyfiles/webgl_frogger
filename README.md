# webgl_frogger
A simple frogger game for the browser that uses no external resources

## Rules
The game does not keep score aside from showing which goals you have successfully reached. When all goals are reached, you must refresh to start again.

The mechanics are similar to the original frogger. Grass and road are safe but going on water will cause a respawn. When on the road getting hit by a car or running into the side/back of one will cause a respawn. Riding on a log or a turtle is safe, but if the log/turtle hits the side of the map or the the turtle dives under the water you will respawn. Lastly, the dark grass at the far side of the level is not safe and jumping there will cause a respawn.

## Controls
### Movement - WASD and Arrow Keys
Movement can only happen in four directions and is controlled by either using WASD or the arrow keys. There is no notion of jumping or other movements.

### First person view - "!"
The exclamation mark will toggle between the standard overhead view and a first person/second person view that follows close behind the frog as it navigates the level.
